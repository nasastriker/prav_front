A VueJS directive for downloading files that are under a protected route schema (that needs an Authorization Header).

It's a common thing on projects to have routes that are wrapped by an authentication middleware. Sometimes, depending on the project security schema, the access to files can be protected too. The problem is, that when in your frontend you put a link (an anchor tag) to a file that is protected, it can be tricky to make the authorization process. This is where this little plugin comes to help.

This plugin comes in the form of a Vue.js directive that is ready to work with JWT auth schema. On the GET request made by an anchor tag when it's clicked, it adds the `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` header automatically.

### üì¶ Installation
```bash
npm install --save vue-auth-href
# or
yarn add vue-auth-href
```
### üîß Initialization
JWT Token must be set in order to the download works. It can be set via option in the initialization, providing a function that returns the JWT Token, or inline.

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueAuthHref from 'vue-auth-href'
import store from "store/index"

// Not mandatory, options can be set inline
const options = {
  token: () => store.getters["jwt_token"], // Note that this MUST BE a function that returns the token.
  // other options here (full list of options described below)
}
Vue.use(VueAuthHref, options)
```

### üïπ Usage

```html
<!-- Initialization via Options:  -->
<a v-auth-href href="https://link.to/your/protected/file.zip">Your File</a>

<!-- Inline Initialization:  -->
<a v-auth-href="{ dotsAnimation: false }" href="https://link.to/your/protected/file.zip">Your File</a>
```
##### üîé Demo:
![Demo 1](https://github.com/nachodd/vue-auth-href/blob/master/demo_1.gif)


Some options can be passed inline to the directive, like:
```html
<a v-auth-href="{token: 'TOKEN'}" href="https://link.to/your/protected/file.zip">Your File</a>
```
### ‚öôÔ∏è Options

| `headerAuthValuePrefix` | String | "Bearer " | Initialization | The prefix of the value used in the authorization header |
